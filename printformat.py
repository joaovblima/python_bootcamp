"""Print Format.
Write an expression using anu of the string formatting methods we have learned
(except f-strings) to return the phrase "Python rules!"

For example, these phrases both return "I like apples":
    "I like %s"  % "apples"
    "I like {}".format("apples")

Your solution should be entered on one line. You cant noto use variable names, 
only the strings themselves.

NOTE: At this time, f-strings won't work!
Udemy Coding Exercises use Python 3.5.2, and f-strings require Python 3.6 or 
higher.
